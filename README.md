Project Name: SMACOFL

Description: SMACOFL is a website where you can hire freelancer smart contract developers to develop your contract or find your next smart contract project job as a freelancer.

Problem: In present freelancer services, website is only the middleman. However, it gets a fee in every deal also some reliance problems may occur between hirer and freelancer like one of them may quit the job or dont pay afterwards.

How to solve: SMACOFL runs a smart contract for every deal. Payment will be automaticly done by smart contract also if one of the hirer or freelancer quits, it pays a penalty payment from who quits to the other.

Features: Hirer and freelancer decides on milestones of project, whenever they complete a milestone of the project contract automaticly pays the certain amount of money for every milestone from hirer to freelancer.
Last milestone worths 3 times then a common one. It incentivise the freelancer to complete and not to quit when they have good amount of money.
Whenever one of the hirer or freelancer quits, smart contract makes a penalty payment from who quits to the other.


Benefits: SMACOFL increases the trust between sides and decrease the possibility to scam for both ends.
It doesnt get fee, so it is a cheaper way then traditional ones.
In a common freelancer website, there is so many topics so its more complicated. SMACOFL is only for smart contract development, so it is simpler to find a job or a freelancer.

It is still in progress. I have only finished Smart Contract side. I will build a website in the future.
